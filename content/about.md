      Virtually(Creative).ca was registered on August 26th, 2010. But the start
      of this journey was actually back in 2008 working as a Security guard.
      Wanting more I taught myself HTML, CSS2 and Javascript and the rest, is
      history. It's been 11 years in the web development space and I enjoy every
      minute of it.


      Al Romano is a self-taught, Full Stack Web Developer with a knack for web
      analytics and data visualization dashboards. A strong advocate of
      inclusive design; firm believer of "user experience first" and HTML First
      Prototyping approaches when applying best practice standards for web
      development.


      Starting out as a PHP (LAMP) developer (you guessed it, WordPress...) but
      around 3 years ago taken an interest in Information Dashboard design and
      data visualization using JavaScript as well as becoming more proficient
      using Node.js both for pipeline and for building applications (MExN & JAM
      stacks).


      Our professional portfolio includes international ad agencies like Saatchi
      & Saatchi and Upcoming Media, local bioinformatics and technology startups
      like Cyclica and I am currently helping the cause at SickKids Foundation
      full-time.
