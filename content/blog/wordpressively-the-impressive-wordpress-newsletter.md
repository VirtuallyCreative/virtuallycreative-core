### Additional Information

**Links:**

The newsletter contains links that may or may not be affiliate links. All links that are affiliate links are denoted as such within the newsletter on a per-link basis with the _\[affiliate\]_ tag next to them. The majority of links won't be affiliate or paid links but will contain Google Analytics tracking info.

**Sponsored Content:**

Since a majority of the links aren't affiliate based, the newsletter does rely, on time to time, a content sponsor to help provide additional funding for the newsletter to help me bring you impressive WordPress content! The Google Analytics tags on all links helps me spread the word of the newsletter by showing up in other people's various analytics and helps provide link back for any newsletters that contain sponsored content. Please include them when minifying your links while sharing, I appreciate it!\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[vc\_btn title="Get WordPressively in your inbox, free!" style="3d" color="sky" size="lg" align="center" i\_icon\_fontawesome="fa fa-wordpress" add\_icon="true" link="url:https%3A%2F%2Fwordpressively.substack.com%2Fmembership||target:%20\_blank|"\]\[/vc\_column\]\[vc\_column width="1/3"\]\[vc\_widget\_sidebar sidebar\_id="primary"\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
