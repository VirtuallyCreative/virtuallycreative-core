#### Conclusion

Both HootSuite and Sprout Social offer features that benefit anyone looking to master their influence and connectivity online. Personally, after using both platforms simultaneously I would have to say I'm leaning towards Sprout Social, but only ever so slightly. I love both for different reasons. I enjoy Hootsuite's organization of streams on the homepage and the ability to customize my reporting outputs give kudos towards Hootsuite, but the reporting layout of Sprout's metrics and their light-themed dashboard layout I just find more pleasurable to look at, and when you spend as much time as I do using the services it starts to make a difference. Also, Sprout Social's "Discovery" features personally gives it a leg up against all other competition. Knowing who isn't following you but is influential in your network is a fantastic metric to help you connect better and achieve higher quality followers.
