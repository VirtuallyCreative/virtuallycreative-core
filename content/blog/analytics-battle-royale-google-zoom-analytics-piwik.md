Running a website can be a challenging and time consuming past time. The modern webmaster has plenty to do, even when using a Content Management System like WordPress or Drupal that make having a website a relatively painless process.

### Analytics are Important, right?

Thankfully, there are plenty of tools in the webmasters' arsenal.  Agreeably, the most important tool is good Analytics installed on your website. If you don't currently have analytics installed on your website you're missing out! Having a powerful analytics platform allows you to make critical decisions about your website, its content, your users and learn insight into loads of other factors that help to manage your time by putting it into the right direction.

Have you ever tried to drive a car, while blindfolded? Well without analytics you're missing out on a lot of information that could derail the path of growth your website is on and how your users use your website as well. This could mean lower sales or conversion rates, little account creations or other scenarios you want to avoid! Just like how seeing keeps you and the car on the road, having good analytics will help you navigate the road-map that is the internet and it's traffic.

### A Battle Royale!

We know that our website must have analytics and that it's really important because it will help us make critical webmaster decisions but, which platform should we pick? With quite a bit of choice out there, we have picked our top 3 favourite platforms used regularly either on our own in-house websites or deployed for our clients and will go through a blow-by-blow comparison to see which is the ultimate platform to use for your WordPress website.

### Google Analytics

The largest internet company on the planet offers [a free to use Analytics platform](http://google.com/analytics "Google Analytics"). It's one of _the_ most used platforms and sets the standard for online analytics. Although you're handing over your website and user traffic data to Google to share with advertising but, in doing so, you gain a powerful analytics system that syncs well with other Google internet products and services like [Webmaster](http://www.google.com/webmasters/ "Google Webmasters Tools"), [Adwords](http://www.google.com/adwords/ "Google Adwords") and [Adsense](http://www.google.com/adsense/start/ "Google Adsense"). All three of which are powerful tools for a webmaster if utilized properly. Webmaster, Adwords and Adsense can easily be topics of their own so we will focus on the Analytics service, its features, pitfalls and how it stacks up compared to our other two analytics systems under the spotlight.

#### Breakdown

Zoom Analytics might not boast eye catching charts and graphs but one of the best features you won't find anywhere else is: Insights.

Produced by the Zoom Analytics engine daily, the engine looks for hidden connections between your website [goals](http://zoomanalytics.co/basic-definition/#goals) and users' [actions](http://zoomanalytics.co/basic-definition/#actions) and [properties](http://zoomanalytics.co/basic-definition/#properties). Goals and actions can be defined using the [JavaScript API](http://zoomanalytics.co/docs/api/), by the [ClickWizard](http://zoomanalytics.co/docs/click-wizard/), or from the settings page (when you are signed in). The Insight Engine looks for insights regarding your data to help you make informed decisions about your website. For example, you have an e-commerce site you might find that there is a connection between the amount spent and number of previous visits.

The power that Insights provides is one of the features that sets Zoom Analytics apart from the rest but the Campaign feature is the highlight of the system in our personal opinion. Campaigns, in a nutshell, allow you to target specific visitor segments just before they leave your website. When its determined that user is about to leave the website (based on on-site behavior) a check is done to see if the visitor matches the rules of a campaign. If so, an overlay popup (non-blocking) campaign is shown. These popups grab the user's attention and have relatively high click-through-rate. Creating a campaign takes no more than a few minutes. You can use one of the ready-made templates or provide your own design. Defining the rules for a campaign is very simple - just choose the rules (visit duration, entry time, geo-location etc.) and set the values (e.g. visitors coming from Canada, entering the website between 15:00-16:00, and visit duration is between 2-5 minutes). To decide on the exact rules for a campaign you can use the BI engine (mentioned above). It produces insights on your goals.

**Following are just a few examples of things you could do with a targeted real-time campaign on Zoom Analytics:**

##### Lead generation

\- Offer your free e-book - Subscribe to your newsletter - Let users directly leave their email or phone number

##### Registration to service

Implement your registration form in the popup.

##### Offer discount

Provide the user a discount coupon.

##### 'Contact us' form

Let your users send a message easily from within the popup, if they have not reached a specific goal. Maybe they had a problem.

##### Bring the user to a page she hasn't visited yet

When user leaves your website without converting and without visiting one of your better-converting pages, suggest she visit that page before leaving. Clicking on the popup button will redirect to the page.

##### Promote a product

Launching a new product or service? easily promote it to all your visitors. Just define the campaign to be active on all pages for all users who have not seen the product page yet.

##### Poles

Implement a short pole inside the popup, or just ask if user is willing to participate, and if so then redirect to another page.

With so much power inside such a packed analytics package its no surprise it made it onto our small battle list. Anyone obsessed with conversion rates and e-commerce  growth, this is one worth checking out.

### Piwik Analytics

With open source comes security and no one takes that more seriously than Piwik. By giving you the platform to host on your own servers you can keep all your information, data and analytics to yourself.
