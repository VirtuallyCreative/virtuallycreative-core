      The Direwolves airsoft team uses two platforms, Ghost CMS & Discourse in
      tandem to create their online presence for their airsoft team members,
      hosted on DigitalOcean for a robust architecture that scales as needed.


      The solution uses a webhook between Ghost and Discourse to create an SSO
      connection so users of the Ghost platform that are subscribed also can log
      in to Discourse to continue the discussion. Ghost's comments on each post
      are also powered by Discourse and appear on both sites, synced.
